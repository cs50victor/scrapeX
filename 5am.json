As part of the upgrade, participants may stake ETH tokens to help secure the network. In exchange for staking, participants then receive rewards on their staked ETH. Staked ETH (and rewards) can't be unstaked until Ethereum 2.0 fully launches, which most experts estimate will happen between 2022 and 2024. Please note: the price chart and market stats for ETH2 are simply a copy of the ETH price chart and market stats. \n\nCoinbase plans to support ETH staking throughout the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Eligible customers can stake their ETH on Coinbase, and receive up to 5% APR in rewards (this rate is subject to change, dependent on the network). While staked ETH and rewards are locked in the network during the upgrade, Coinbase plans to provide a way to trade staked ETH for other assets in the future.\nMarket-Cap: $449367572801.74\nVolume(24hrs): $29862319158.46\nCirculating Supply: $11735010218.65\n.Percentage Changes:\n Hour: 1.60068%\n Day: 11.31195%\n Week: 18.21181%\n Month: 49.31514%\n Day: 767.40153%\n All Time: 136507.29626%"
